Reply to an email thread. Context or instructions: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. If a thread ID or subject is given, fetch the thread via Gmail MCP
2. Read the full thread to understand context, tone, and history
3. Identify what is being asked or what action is expected

Write a reply that:
- Acknowledges the key point(s) from the previous message
- Answers every question asked (don't leave questions unanswered)
- States any action you're taking or decision you're making
- Requests anything you need from them
- Matches the tone of the thread (don't be more formal or more casual than the conversation already is)
- Is as short as it can be while being complete — no filler

If the reply requires attachments or links, note the placeholder `[ATTACH: description]`.

Present the reply for review before sending. If $ARGUMENTS says send, use Gmail MCP to send directly.
