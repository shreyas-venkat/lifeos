# Claude Templates

A drop-in `.claude/` configuration for Claude Code providing MCP server setup and a full library of slash commands for daily development work.

## MCP Servers

| Server | Purpose | Key env vars |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `filesystem` | Expanded file access beyond the project root | — |
| `github` | Issues, PRs, reviews, releases, repo management | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `gmail` | Read, compose, reply, and search email | file-based OAuth (one-time setup) |
| `motherduck` | Run SQL against MotherDuck (cloud DuckDB) | `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` |

## Setup

1. Copy the `.claude/` directory, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.mcp.json` into the root of your repo.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials.
3. Export the env vars in your shell before launching Claude Code:
   ```bash
   export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
   # or use direnv: add `dotenv` to your .envrc
   ```
4. Open the project in Claude Code — MCP servers start automatically.
